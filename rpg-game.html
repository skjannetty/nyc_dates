            <p id="game-description">You are a game show contestant on everyone's favorite show "I was a math nerd in high school". Before you are three doors. Behind two doors are goats. Behind the third door are more goats. We're talking TONS of goats. And you can keep as many as you want! All remaining goats will live the rest of their happy lives on a farm run by my soon-to-be sister-in-law. How many goats do you bring home?</p>
