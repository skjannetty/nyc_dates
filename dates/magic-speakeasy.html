            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>MAGIC SHOW WITH DRINKS! Illusions and the thrill of a hidden speakeasy! I'm kind of combining two options here, one is magic shows and the other is speakeasy. There is one option that is both but its a bit expensive.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Various locations in Manhattan, NY</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> 2-3 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> ~$200 per person for the magic. Significantly less if we just go speakeasy.</li>
                <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Mysterious, enchanting, chaotic</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>Some options (not exhaustive):</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><a href="https://speakeasymagick.com/tickets/">Speakeasy Magick</a> at The Overlook Bar "features a rotating roster of NYC's best magicians performing close-up magic in an intimate setting". It's located at 25 West 24th Street in the Flatiron District. Tickets are $180 without drinks/food so v pricy, but it gets good reviews.</li>
                <li><a href="https://chambermagic.com/">Chamber Magic</a> by Steve Cohen at the Lotte New York Palace "offers an elegant parlor magic experience where audiences dress in cocktail attire". It's located at 455 Madison Avenue. Cheapest tickets are $175. I think I actually went to this in high school before it was super popular (#hipsterofmagic #magicclub2010). I think I'd rather do one of the other options but I do remember it being quite impressive.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.thegarretwest.com/">The Garret West</a> is a casual unmarked cocktail bar hidden up a staircase in the back of Five Guys in the West Village. It looks small/chill from the pictures. The cocktails are like $20 a pop. I googled "best speakeasy in nyc" and it came up on a number of lists. There are many others if this is the desired vibe.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This option is a little underbaked. I feel like we have other bars we already want to go to, so I think the first offering is the most serious (magic + drinks) but its also pretty expensive.</p>
