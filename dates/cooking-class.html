            <p>Here are some cooking class options in Manhattan that have availability this week/weekend:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><a href="https://www.homecookingny.com/">Home Cooking New York</a> is in SoHo. It looks like they have a lot of class availability while we are there. Some class options include <a href="https://app.getoccasion.com/p/n/23aaa7f494aa5eaae4d0463aef55e2822057eebb/v5">how to cook shellfish</a>, <a href="https://app.getoccasion.com/p/n/npnBr4c3/v5"> how to cook shawarma/falafel/flatbreads</a>, and <a href="https://app.getoccasion.com/p/n/k6LFXnFn/v5">Thai and Vietnamese flavors</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.cozymeal.com/">Cozymeal</a> is a weird one. Its like airbnb experiences but they're all cooking so you like go in people's apartments and learn from them. Idk could be kind of creepy but there are tons of offerings (all over the place too) could be worth considering.</li>
                <li><a href="https://classbento.com/selfup-nyc?class_secret=yr4f8d6fus">Self Up Cooking Classes</a> is in the financial district. They seem to use a cozymeal-like interface for their sales, but they have a physical location and lots of reviews. Classes have to be booked 48 hours in advanced so if this is the option we want we should act fast. They have a lot of regularly offered classes including <a href="https://classbento.com/japanese-sushi-making-class"> sushi making</a>, romantic <a href="https://classbento.com/romantic-italian-date-night-cooking-class-new-york-city"> Italian</a>, and <a href=https://classbento.com/asian-dumplings-and-dim-sum>dumplings/dim sum</a></li>
