                    <h3>The High Line</h3>
                    <p>You got a sneak peek, but we could start at the entrance to the High Line at Gansevoort Street and walk the length of the park to 34th Street. The High Line features art installations (including one by Ellen's uncle!), gardens, and views of the Hudson River.</p>

                    <h3>Central Park</h3>
                    <p>Lets be real, there's no way we go a trip to NYC without walking around Central Park. We could make it really featured though if we so choose (and perhaps run into an unexpected friend by the sea lion exhibit...)</p>

                    <h3>Brooklyn Bridge to DUMBO</h3>
                    <p>I don't think I've ever walked across the Brooklyn Bridge. We could start at City Hall Park, cross the Brooklyn Bridge, and explore the DUMBO area. We could even combine this with the brewery tour walk idea and hit up some of the great breweries in that area.</p>

                    <h3>West Village to Greenwich Village</h3>
                    <p>These are also areas I don't know well. We would start our walk at Washington Square Park and explore.</p>
